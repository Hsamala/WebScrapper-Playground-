# WebScrapper-Playground-
Playground for me to learn and play with Webscrapping during the Summer of 2024. 

# Webscrapper.py 
webscrapper.py: 1st iteration of the Webscrapper. It scraps the static html website of https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/ site and returns all of the python jobs and links to the CLI. Very basic but a stepping stone for the final project.
