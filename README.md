# WebScrapper-Playground-
Playground for me to learn and play with Webscrapping during the Summer of 2024. 

# Webscrapper.py 
webscrapper.py: 1st iteration of the Webscrapper. It scraps the static html website of https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/ site and returns all of the python jobs and links to the CLI. Very basic but a stepping stone for the final project. 

# Webscrapper2.py
Webscrapper2.py: 1st iteration of the Webscrapper on the Remote.co website but the 3rd iteration of webscrapping in general. This includes CLI input, parsing through for Freelance, Part-time, and Full-time from CLI input. However, still need to add JSON input support, might happen later today.
